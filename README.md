# Learning the C++ Standard Template Library

## What is the STL?
C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is a collection of pre-defined data structures and algorithms that are commonly used in programming problems, especially those pertaining to the highly competitive domain of competitive programming (CP). These data structures and algorithms come ready to implement out-of-the-box as classes that we create instances of. No more reinventing the wheel.

## About this repository
Using the STL in C++ makes implementing more logically intensive solutions for competitive programming problems a breeze. This repository is dedicated to learning to get the most out of the STL in C++ by practicing common problems in CP.
