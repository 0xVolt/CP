### This question was asked in an online test for a company recruitment

**the problem was that ethan is developing a game and it's called entering romulus and the main character playing the game have to enter the tallest building from the array of supplied buildings but he can choose only from n portion of the given length of the array**
*for example suppose 7 buildings are there, we input [12,1,8,9,3,48] and size of n is 2 so first he is allowed to choose from 12 and 1 and then after choosing he can choose again from 1 and 8*

**He can choose multiple buildings with same length, we have to calculate the maximum possible score, score=score+height he choose**

**the concept I used is sliding window of arrays**
*Note- this is not the best solution*
